## Project Introduction

An interactive mobile application developed using technologies like Augmented Reality to ensure children have an educational and entertaining flight experience. It allows users to draw flight routes between cities on a map of Turkey. At each stop, children can play AR-enhanced memory card games and age-based word puzzle games with scoring systems, timers, and hints.
